# Synthetic Data Project Code

This project is part of my master thesis on Synthetic Data Generation.
The thesis was supervised by Prof. Dr. Patrick Cheridito (ETH ZÃ¼rich), Dr. Koushik Balasubramanian (ADIA) and Dr. Vincent Zoonekynd (ADIA).

The goal is to generate synthetic data and evaluate it. As training data we used the S\&P 500 daily stock returns.

## Setup

The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a
python version manager. To setup this project, install poetry
and run `poetry install` in the projects root directory. You
will an installation of python 3.6 (preferably with managed with
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)).

To compile the C++ components of the project, go to the `boosted`
directory and call `setup.sh`.

Further for the plots it is necessary to have latex installed.
More exact requirements are specified in the
[matplotlib documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/text/pgf.html)

Lastly you need to configure the some environment variables,
as the code depends on it for
storing and caching data.
This can be achieved by defining the variables in `.env`
and installing the
[Poetry Dotenv Plugin](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-dotenv-plugin/).
Necessary variables are

- WANDB_ENTITIY
- WANDB_PROJECT
- WANDB_API_KEY
- RESULT_DIR
- DATA_DIR
- THESIS_DIR

The first three environment variables:
`WANDB_API_KEY`, `WANDB_ENTITY` and `WANDB_PROJECT` are used to
set up online logging with [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/).
The variable `RESULT_DIR` specifies the directory to store
training results, `DATA_DIR` further specifies the directory
to store and cache data used for training. And
last but not least, `THESIS_DIR` specifies a directory
for the scripts to output figures and tables.

## Run the models

## Code organization

The main folder is `src` containing all the source code.
Moreover, `scripts` contains a had full of scripts
evaluation and training.
The `notebooks` with for jupyter notebooks, contains mostly
experimental code and is used as a kind of scratch paper
convenient to try new ideas.
Unit tests are in `tests` and the `boosted` directory
contains some bits of `c++` code to speed up certain functions.

### src

The source folder is divided into further folder
by categories. For example, each Architecture contains
it's own folder with some files defining the model and
a training scripts.

One of the more important folders is the `stylized_facts`
subfolder. It contains the code for the computations
of the stylized facts, stylized scores and stylized losses.
In particular most of the functionality used
for the evaluation of the models.

The `visualization` subfolder contains code for
plotting stylized facts, result plots and tables.
